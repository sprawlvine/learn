+ **shutil**     
  shutil - Utility functions for copying and archiving files and directory trees
+ **sched**  
  The [sched](https://pymotw.com/2/sched/index.html#module-sched "sched: Generic event scheduler.") module implements a generic event scheduler for running tasks at specific times
+ **contextlib**    
  contextlib - Utilities for with-statement contexts
+ **multiprocessing**   
  This package is intended to duplicate the functionality (and much of
  the API) of threading.py but uses processes instead of threads.  A
  subpackage 'multiprocessing.dummy' has the same API but is a simple
   wrapper for 'threading'.
